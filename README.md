This package enables **telemetry** in you project.
It uses *AWS Distro for Opentelemetry* to trace every request in your project.
Auto-instrumentation has been done to trace HTTP, DNS, DB, Winston etc services.
TraceId have been injected in logs to co-relate logs and traces.
Logger instance also comes from this package itself.

**Installation**

1. Import `adotInit()` in app.ts and call it in constructor of the class in this file. This will instrument the telemetry code and initialize the tracer for your project.
   

```
import {traceDecorator} from "nodejs-telemetry";
   class App{
      constructor(){
         adotInit(<resourceServiceName>, <healthCheckEndpointUrl>);
         // some other code.
      }
   }

```
2. Import traceDecorator(), which is a decorator function, in all of the files where you want to trace your code.

```
import {traceDecorator} from "nodejs-telemetry";
```

3. Apply `@traceDecorator()` on top of the methods you want to trace.

```
@traceDecorator()
public async someFn(){
   //some code
}
```
4. This trace decorator will automatically create spans and subspans for continuous code and will automatically log any error encountered against that trace.

```
@traceDecorator()
public async someFn(){
   logger.info("some message");
   //some code

}
```

And you are **Done**!
